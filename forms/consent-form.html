		The Doctor and/or staff have explained to me the proposed treatment and the anticipated results of such treatment.  I understand this is an elective procedure and that there are other forms of treatment available, including the option of no treatment. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Doctor has explained to me that there are certain potential risks in the treatment plan or procedure.  These could include but are not limited to:  infection, heart attack, stroke, bleeding, damage to teeth, vocal cords, nerves, organ failure, necessary hospitalization and death. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Unforeseen conditions may arise during the procedure that requires a different procedure than as set forth above.  I therefore authorize the Doctor and any associates to perform such procedures when, in their professional judgment, they are necessary. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I understand that the medications taken for this procedure may cause some side effects.  I understand that I should not consume alcohol or other drugs because they can increase these effects.  I have been advised not to work or operate any automobile or hazardous devices while taking such medications and until fully recovered from their effects.

		It has been explained to me and I understand that a perfect result is not guaranteed or warranted.
